): Promise<AchievementResult> {
  // Logic to check for badges and trophies based on game stats
  // Return list of newly earned rewards
}
```

   - `BadgeDisplay.tsx` - For showing earned badges
   - `TrophyCase.tsx` - For displaying earned trophies
   - `AvatarCustomizer.tsx` - For customizing avatar
   - `RewardNotification.tsx` - For notifying users of new rewards

2. Update the profile page to show badges and trophies

3. Create a new reward shop UI for purchasing avatar items

### 3.4 Phase 4: Avatar System (Week 4)

1. Implement avatar customization system
2. Create avatar rendering component
3. Implement item purchasing system with coin integration
4. Add avatar progression logic based on badges earned

### 3.5 Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Week 5)

1. Integrate reward notifications into game flow
2. Add animations for earning new rewards
3. Create achievement progress tracking
4. Implement leaderboards for badges and trophies
5. Add tutorial elements for the reward system
6. Test and optimize performance

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 New React Context: `RewardContext`

```typescript
// src/contexts/RewardContext.tsx
interface RewardContextType {
  badges: Badge[];
  userBadges: UserBadge[];
  trophies: Trophy[];
  userTrophies: UserTrophy[];
  avatarItems: AvatarItem[];
  userAvatarItems: UserAvatarItem[];
  checkForAchievements: (gameStats: UserGameStats) => Promise<AchievementResult>;
  purchaseAvatarItem: (itemId: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  equipAvatarItem: (itemId: string, type: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  refreshRewards: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### 4.2 New Hooks

```typescript
// src/hooks/useUserRewards.ts
function useUserRewards(userId: string) {
  // Logic to fetch and manage user rewards
}

// src/hooks/useAvatarItems.ts
function useAvatarItems(userId: string) {
  // Logic to fetch and manage avatar items
}
```

### 4.3 Database Integration with Firebase

```typescript
// src/firebase/rewardUtils.ts
export async function earnBadge(userId: string, badgeId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Logic to award a badge to a user
}

export async function earnTrophy(userId: string, trophyId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Logic to award a trophy to a user
}

export async function purchaseAvatarItem(userId: string, itemId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Logic to handle item purchase with coins
}
```

### 4.4 Game Component Integration

Update the game result handling in all game components:

```typescript
// In game completion handler
const handleGameCompletion = async () => {
  // Existing code for saving game stats
  await saveGameStats(user.id, {
    gameType: 'multiplication',
    score,
    totalQuestions: TOTAL_QUESTIONS,
    timeSpent: time,
    history: gameHistory,
    difficulty
  });

  // New code for checking achievements
  const achievementResults = await checkForAchievements(user.id, {
    gameType: 'multiplication',
    score,
    totalQuestions: TOTAL_QUESTIONS,
    timeSpent: time,
    history: gameHistory,
    difficulty
  });

  // Handle newly earned rewards
  if (achievementResults.newBadges.length > 0 || achievementResults.newTrophies.length > 0) {
    // Show reward notifications
    setRewardNotifications(achievementResults);
  }

  // Navigate to results page
  navigate('/proof', { 
    state: { 
      score, 
      totalQuestions: TOTAL_QUESTIONS, 
      timeSpent: time,
      gameType: 'multiplication',
      newRewards: achievementResults 
    } 
  });
};
```

## 9. Conclusion

This reward system will significantly enhance user engagement and motivation by providing clear goals and visual progress indicators. The multi-tiered approach with badges, trophies, and avatar customization offers both short-term and long-term achievements to keep users engaged and motivated to improve their math skills.

Implementation should proceed in phases as outlined above, with regular testing and user feedback incorporated throughout the development process.
